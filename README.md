# Age Prediction (Regression)

This project focuses on mastering data preprocessing and building machine learning models for regression tasks. The goal is to predict age based on various health and lifestyle factors.

## Preprocessing
- Filling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.

## Models
### Linear Regression:
- Metrics: MSE, Variance, R² score.

### Random Forest:
- Metrics: MSE, R² score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Human Age Prediction Synthetic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullah0a/human-age-prediction-synthetic-dataset) from Kaggle.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
